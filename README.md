GameForCrypto

Game for crypto (GFC) aims to bring competitive gaming to the block chain. GFC provides a safe and transparent way to create gaming contests, 
with an easy to understand entry fee (Credits), and automatically distributes the contest credits to the winner. Gamers can withdrawl credits at anytime,
which is sent back in ETH. Contests will be confirmed using the Chainlink API Oracle. 

Currently, GFC is only supporting two games, Fortnite and Snake. GFC is working on creating an easy to use API for game developers to include in games. 
Snake is an open source simple snake game, which will be the first to use the API.

Contests for fortnite include number of eliminations, number of matches in top 10, number of matches in 1st place. GFC is already tracking fortnite data though
their public API. Only matchmaking, solo, battle Royale stats are counted (so standard fortnite). These matches should be fair for everyone, as far as I know.

Contests for snake will include a larger pool of players, and will likely be top score after a certain amount of rounds, or reaching a certain score.

This project is early in development, just started last week. Smart contract mostly functional, Cloud functions tracking gaming stats, and interface is basic but allows deposting eth for credits, tracking credits, creating a contest, joining a contest, and withdrawling credits for eth. 

I am keeping the front end, and backend cloud functions private for the time being. Although I will consider releasing after the Hackathon is over. 

GFC is currently only 1 person, Myself, Geoff Kemper. Im a full stack freelance developer, specializing in Node, React, React Native, MongoDB, Google Firebase, 
Amazon AWS, and web app development in general. I am potentially interested in working with a front end designer who is proficient in React. If you are interested, 
or have any questions / comments, please email GameForCrypto@gmail.com

Thanks for checking out my Hackathon project!
